# Secure-OSS-Compliance-Release-Automation-Pipeline

Goals:
Continuous SAST/SCA/DAST with policy gates.
SBOM (SPDX + CycloneDX) generated on every build.
License risk detection (GPL vs. MIT/Apache) and developer guidance.
REST API + dashboard so teams can see risks per commit/release.
100% open-source tools.

Case study & problem statement : 
Automate the auditable platform that shifts security and license compliance left, giving developers early, actionable feedback, and gates releases on critical risks.
